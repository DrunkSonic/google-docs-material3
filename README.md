# Google Docs M3 Editor
This CSS theme aims to build on top of Google's overhaul of the Google Docs editor by adding another layer of customization.

## What's changed?
There are numerous changes:
1. If you have the Circular STD font installed, that will become the new UI font.
2. There are more rounded corners for a friendlier look, including pages in Google Docs.
3. Colors are more emphasized, yet harmonized. You can also customize your color in accordance with Google's Material 3 UI guidelines.

## Where will this be applied?
1. Google Docs
2. Google Slides
3. Google Sheets
This theme was originally intended for Google Docs, so the theme may not be complete in other apps.

## Prerequisites
Use any CSS injector for your browser. CSS injectors allow you to inject custom CSS code into any website, including Google Docs.

**More themes are coming soon!** Alternatively, you can use the [Material Theme Builder]([url](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/)) to create your own colors and replace the color values in the `root {` element with the respective HEX codes that the generator gives you. Ensure you use the **light theme** values, **not the dark theme!**
